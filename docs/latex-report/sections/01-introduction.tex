\section{Introduction}

The rapid advancement of machine learning and artificial intelligence has led to unprecedented data generation and processing requirements. However, traditional centralized machine learning approaches face significant challenges in terms of privacy, scalability, and regulatory compliance. Federated Learning (FL) \cite{mcmahan2017communication} has emerged as a paradigm-shifting approach that enables distributed machine learning while preserving data privacy and reducing communication overhead.

\subsection{Background and Motivation}

Federated Learning represents a fundamental shift from centralized to decentralized machine learning, where models are trained across multiple devices or organizations without sharing raw data \cite{li2020federated}. This approach addresses critical challenges in modern ML deployments:

\begin{itemize}    \item \textbf{Data Privacy}: Sensitive data remains on local devices, reducing privacy risks
    \item \textbf{Regulatory Compliance}: Adherence to data protection regulations (GDPR, HIPAA)
    \item \textbf{Bandwidth Efficiency}: Only model updates are shared, not raw data
    \item \textbf{Edge Computing}: Enables training on resource-constrained devices \cite{wang2019edge}
    \item \textbf{Collaborative Learning}: Organizations can benefit from collective knowledge without data sharing
\end{itemize}

However, federated learning systems face several fundamental challenges that impact practical deployment \cite{kairouz2019advances}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Statistical Heterogeneity}: Non-IID data distribution across clients can significantly impact convergence \cite{zhao2018federated}
    \item \textbf{System Heterogeneity}: Varying computational capabilities and network conditions across participating devices
    \item \textbf{Security Vulnerabilities}: Byzantine attacks and model poisoning threats \cite{blanchard2017machine,fang2020local}
    \item \textbf{Communication Efficiency}: High communication costs in distributed training environments
    \item \textbf{Privacy Guarantees}: Ensuring true privacy preservation beyond data locality
\end{itemize}

However, federated learning systems operate in complex network environments where factors such as network latency, bandwidth limitations, device heterogeneity, and security policies significantly impact performance \cite{bonawitz2019towards}. Traditional FL research often overlooks these network-level considerations, leading to a gap between theoretical advances and practical deployments.

\subsection{Problem Statement}

Existing federated learning platforms and research frameworks suffer from several limitations:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Network Abstraction}: Most FL frameworks abstract away network complexities, limiting realistic experimentation
    \item \textbf{Policy Enforcement}: Lack of comprehensive policy engines for security and compliance
    \item \textbf{Observability Gaps}: Limited visibility into the interaction between ML training and network behavior
    \item \textbf{Scalability Constraints}: Difficulty in simulating large-scale, realistic network topologies
    \item \textbf{Integration Challenges}: Isolated research environments that don't reflect real-world deployments
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Research Contributions}
