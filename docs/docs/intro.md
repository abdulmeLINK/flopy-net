# Welcome to FLOPY-NET

**Observe, Control, and Understand Federated Learning in Realistic Networks**

FLOPY-NET is an open-source observatory platform designed specifically for researchers to study the direct impact of network dynamics‚Äîfrom packet loss to complex topologies‚Äîon the performance, security, and behavior of Federated Learning systems.

## What is FLOPY-NET?

FLOPY-NET bridges the gap between theoretical federated learning research and real-world network conditions. Traditional FL research often assumes perfect network conditions, but real networks are messy, unreliable, and constantly changing. Our platform lets you:

- **Simulate realistic network conditions** with configurable packet loss, latency, and bandwidth constraints
- **Monitor FL training** in real-time with comprehensive dashboards and metrics
- **Enforce security policies** through our integrated Policy Engine
- **Study network impact** on model convergence, accuracy, and training efficiency
- **Experiment with different topologies** using GNS3 integration and SDN controllers

## Research Applications

FLOPY-NET is designed for researchers studying:

- **Network-aware Federated Learning**: How do real network conditions affect FL performance?
- **Security in Distributed ML**: Can malicious nodes be detected and mitigated?
- **Edge Computing Scenarios**: How does FL perform on resource-constrained edge devices?
- **Network Optimization**: What network configurations optimize FL training?
- **Fault Tolerance**: How resilient is FL to network failures and partitions?

## Components Overview

### üéõÔ∏è CLI Interface
Unified command-line interface (`src/main.py`) for starting services, running scenarios, and managing the platform.

### üõ°Ô∏è Policy Engine
The heart of FLOPY-NET's security and governance system (Port 5000), enforcing rules and monitoring compliance across all components.

### üìä Collector
Comprehensive metrics collection system (Port 8000) gathering data from FL training, network performance, and system health.

### ü§ñ FL Framework
Docker-based federated learning implementation with server (192.168.100.10) and multiple clients (192.168.100.101-102).

### üåê Networking
GNS3 integration (`src/networking/gns3/`) with SDN support (Port 6633/8181) for realistic network simulation and control.

### üé¨ Scenarios
Configurable scenarios (`src/scenarios/`) for testing different network conditions, FL algorithms, and research hypotheses.
