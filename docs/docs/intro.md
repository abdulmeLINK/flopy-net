# Welcome to FLOPY-NET

**Federated Learning Observatory Platform - Network Emulation & Testing**

FLOPY-NET is a comprehensive research platform for evaluating federated learning algorithms under realistic network conditions. It bridges the gap between theoretical federated learning research and real-world network dynamics by providing an integrated environment that combines the Flower federated learning framework, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) with Ryu controllers, network emulation through GNS3, and comprehensive monitoring capabilities.

## What is FLOPY-NET?

FLOPY-NET enables researchers to conduct realistic federated learning experiments that account for complex network interactions. Traditional FL research often assumes perfect network conditions, but real networks exhibit variable latency, packet loss, bandwidth limitations, and complex topologies that significantly impact FL system performance.

Our platform provides:

- **Flower-based FL Framework** with PyTorch model support for MNIST, CIFAR-10, and custom datasets
- **Policy-Driven Architecture** with centralized governance, security enforcement, and real-time compliance monitoring
- **GNS3 Network Simulation** with configurable packet loss, latency, bandwidth constraints, and dynamic topology changes
- **SDN Integration** using Ryu OpenFlow controllers for programmable network behavior and policy enforcement
- **Real-time Observatory** with React-based dashboards, comprehensive metrics collection, and interactive network visualization
- **Container Architecture** with Docker Compose orchestration, static IP assignment, and service discovery
- **Comprehensive Metrics** stored in SQLite with time-series analysis and research data export capabilities
