# Git Setup Summary

This document outlines the Git configuration we've established for the Federated Learning with SDN Integration project.

## Files Created

1. **`.gitignore`**: Configuration file specifying which files and directories to exclude from version control
   - Excludes Python bytecode, virtual environments, data files, logs, and temporary files
   - Ignores model files that can be large (`.h5`, `.pt`, etc.)
   - Excludes development environment files and IDE-specific configurations

2. **`.gitattributes`**: Configuration file for file handling in Git
   - Sets proper line ending management (`text=auto`)
   - Specifies file-type-specific handling for Python, Shell, and PowerShell scripts
   - Includes commented configuration for Git LFS if needed for large files

3. **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: Guidelines for contributors
   - Defines the Git workflow and branching strategy
   - Provides commit message guidelines
   - Explains how to handle large files with Git LFS
   - Includes information on code style, testing, and documentation

4. **`init-git.sh` and `init-git.ps1`**: Scripts to initialize the Git repository
   - Sets up the repository with proper configuration
   - Configures line ending handling
   - Sets up Git LFS if installed
   - Creates a development branch
   - Makes an initial commit with the configuration files

## Repository Structure

The repository follows a simplified Git Flow branching model:
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `dev`: Development branch, integrate features here
- Feature branches: Created from `dev` with naming convention `feature/your-feature-name`
- Bug fix branches: Created from `dev` with naming convention `fix/bug-description`

## Large File Handling

For large files (such as trained models or datasets):
- Git LFS configuration is ready but commented out
- Files with extensions `.h5`, `.pt`, `.pth`, and `.onnx` can be tracked with Git LFS
- Uncomment the relevant lines in `.gitattributes` when needed

## Code Fixes

We've also made some optimizations to the codebase to work better with Git:

1. Fixed import statements in `policy_engine/__init__.py` and `dashboard/__init__.py`
   - Added try/except blocks to handle missing modules
   - This prevents import errors when checking out older versions

2. Made shell scripts executable and writable

## How to Use

For each new clone of the repository, developers should:

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
2. Run the appropriate initialization script for their OS
3. Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for guidelines on making changes
4. Follow the Git workflow defined in the project documentation

## Next Steps

1. Push the repository to a remote Git hosting service
2. Consider setting up Git hooks for pre-commit checks
3. Configure branch protection rules in the remote repository
4. Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing
