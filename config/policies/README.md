# FLOPY-NET Policy Definitions

This directory contains policy definitions for the FLOPY-NET Policy Engine, which enforces rules and security policies across all system components.

## Active Policy Configuration

**Primary Policy File**: `policies.json`

This is the main active policy file used by the Policy Engine in the default Docker Compose setup. The Policy Engine service is configured via `config/policy_engine/policy_config.json`, which points to this file through its `"policy_file"` key.

**To modify system-wide policies, edit `policies.json`.**

## Policy File Structure

```json
{
  "policies": [
    {
      "name": "policy_name",
      "type": "policy_type",
      "conditions": {...},
      "actions": {...},
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Additional Policy Files

Other JSON files in this directory serve different purposes:

- **`default_policies.json`**: Backup/reference set of default policies
- **Other policy files**: Alternative policy sets, examples, or archived configurations

### Policy File Management

For clarity and to avoid confusion:

1. **Active Policies**: Always use `policies.json` for active system policies
2. **Alternatives**: Consider moving alternative policy files to `examples/` or `archived/` subdirectories
3. **Swapping Policies**: To use different policy sets, modify `config/policy_engine/policy_config.json` to point to the desired policy file

## Policy Types

The Policy Engine supports various policy types:

### Security Policies
- **Authentication**: Client authentication and authorization rules
- **Trust Management**: Trust score calculations and thresholds
- **Anomaly Detection**: Behavioral anomaly detection rules
- **Access Control**: Resource access permissions

### Federated Learning Policies
- **Client Participation**: Rules for client participation in FL rounds
- **Model Validation**: Model size, complexity, and performance constraints
- **Data Privacy**: Data handling and privacy protection rules
- **Training Parameters**: Learning rate, batch size, and other training constraints

### Network Policies
- **Traffic Management**: Network traffic rules and QoS policies
- **Bandwidth Allocation**: Bandwidth limits and priorities
- **Connection Security**: Secure connection requirements
- **Resource Usage**: Network resource utilization limits

### System Policies
- **Resource Management**: CPU, memory, and storage limits
- **Component Integration**: Inter-component communication rules
- **Monitoring**: Logging and metrics collection policies
- **Maintenance**: System maintenance and update policies

## Policy Engine Integration

The Policy Engine enforces policies through:

1. **Component Queries**: Other services query the Policy Engine for permission checks
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous policy compliance monitoring
3. **Event-driven Actions**: Automatic responses to policy violations
4. **Dashboard Integration**: Policy status visualization and management

## Policy Development

### Creating New Policies

1. **Define Policy Structure**: Specify conditions, actions, and metadata
2. **Test Policy Logic**: Validate policy behavior in test environment
3. **Add to Policy File**: Insert policy into `policies.json`
4. **Verify Integration**: Ensure Policy Engine processes the new policy correctly

### Policy Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual policy rules and conditions
- **Integration Tests**: Test policy enforcement across components
- **Scenario Tests**: Validate policies in realistic scenarios
- **Performance Tests**: Monitor policy evaluation performance

## Custom Policy Functions

Custom policy functions are defined in `config/policy_functions/`:

- **`model_size_policy.json`**: Example policy function for model size validation
- Custom functions can be added following the same pattern

## Policy Compliance and Monitoring

The Policy Engine provides:

- **Real-time Compliance**: Continuous policy compliance checking
- **Violation Logging**: Detailed logging of policy violations
- **Dashboard Integration**: Policy status and compliance visualization
- **Alerting**: Notifications for critical policy violations

## Best Practices

### Policy Design
- **Clear Conditions**: Define precise, testable policy conditions
- **Appropriate Actions**: Specify proportional responses to violations
- **Performance**: Keep policy evaluation efficient
- **Documentation**: Document policy purpose and behavior

### Policy Management
- **Version Control**: Track policy changes over time
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test policies before deployment
- **Monitoring**: Monitor policy performance and effectiveness
- **Review**: Regularly review and update policies

### Security Considerations
- **Least Privilege**: Apply minimum necessary restrictions
- **Defense in Depth**: Layer multiple complementary policies
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain comprehensive policy audit logs
- **Regular Updates**: Keep policies current with system changes
